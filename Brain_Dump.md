Hey Carmen! I was just thinking about you the other day. we are overdue a catch. I've just moved my life into Claude and I have a funny feeling it can now do your tricky xsl things. You buy the coffee and I'll show you what's new!! 

  

Nadia - have you experienced this "missing the soft data"? Interested in your thoughts.

Your AI might be ignoring 60% of what you tell it.  
  
That's the uncomfortable finding from this week's experiment. When I buried a critical fact in the middle of an athlete's journal, the AI missed it more than half the time.  
  
But here's what really got me thinking.  
  
As a runner, I keep a training log. Some of my most important entries aren't the big race days or the breakthrough sessions. They're the quiet Tuesdays when my shin hurts—the Thursday when I almost didn't go out. The Sunday when something clicked mentally, but I couldn't articulate why.  
  
Those middle-of-the-week, middle-of-the-journal moments — that's where the real signal lives. And that's exactly where AI stops paying attention.  
  
This has real consequences. If a coach is using AI to review athlete journals, the tool might flag the dramatic entries (the 26km breakthrough, the race-day anxiety) and completely miss the Tuesday shin splints that — left unaddressed — become a stress fracture by race week.  
  
Quiet data is often the most important. And right now, most AI tools are designed to miss it.  
  
That's why context engineering matters. It's not just a developer concept. It's the difference between an AI that catches everything and one that sounds confident while missing half your data.  
  
Next week: what happens when you try to save money by compressing athlete data? The results are worse than you think.
